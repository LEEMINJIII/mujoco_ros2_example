# MuJoCo-ROS2

> [!NOTE]
> This project is a work-in-progress, so new features will be added slowly.
> Feel free to contribute your own improvements.

This class establishes communication between a MuJoCo simulation and ROS2.

It publishes a `sensor_msgs::msg::JointState` topic for you to use, and allows commands to the joints via a `std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray` topic:

</p>

It can run in `POSITION`, `VELOCITY`, or `TORQUE` mode which may be set via the config and/or launch file(s).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have ROS2 and MuJoCo installed on your system.

1. **Install ROS2:**
   Follow the [ROS2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html) for your operating system.

2. **Install MuJoCo:**
   Download and install MuJoCo from the [official website](https://mujoco.org/).

3. **Install GLFW:**
```
   sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
```

### Building the Project

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Woolfrey/mujoco_ros2
cd mujoco_ros2
```
Build the package:
```
colcon build
```
Source the ROS2 workspace:
```
source install/setup.bash
```

### Usage

#### Launching the Simulation

There are 2 different control modes currently available:

To run **velocity control**, you can launch:
```
ros2 launch mujoco velocity_mode.py
```
This requires that the topic `/joint_commands` contains an array of velocites (in rad/s).

To run **torque control**, you can launch:
```
ros2 launch mujoco torque_mode.py
```
This requires that the topic `/joint_commands` contains an array of torques (Nm).

> [!TIP]
> In torque mode, gravity and Coriolis torques are automatically compensated for.
